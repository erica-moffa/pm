### Detail

* Murphy

  Welcome everyone to the 44th TRON core devs community call. Today we have four topics. First, we will sync up on the development progress of 4.8.1. Second, we'll discuss the new issues found in ARM architecture compatibility. Third, we'll check the impact of optimized cryptographic algorithm. And finally, we'll go over TIP-6780. Now, let's have Neo update us on the development of 4.8.1.


**Syncing the development progress of v4.8.1**

* Neo

  Almost half of the pull requests have been merged. The remaining half is still awaiting approval for merging. Once all are merged, we will need to self-test all the pull requests using the release branch. And then, we'll invite QA team to test.

  Also, we might want to be on the safe side and resynchronize it. This includes resynchronizing on both x86 and ARM platforms. We'll rerun nodes to ensure that the code has no impact on existing x86 platforms and that it runs properly on the ARM platform. This is the most important aspect.

* Murphy

  Ok, is there a rough plan for the release time? Because we would like to let the community know in advance.
  
* Neo
  
  Well, because this ARM version includes more significant changes, we may need to conduct a relatively long grayscale phase for this specific version. Perhaps one to two months or even longer, which means that the expected release time will not be earlier than October.

* Murphy

  Thank you Neo, does any one have more questions about the progress of v4.8.1? If not, we will move to the next topic, let's have Boson update the progress of ARM platform compatibility.
  

**Expand ARM Architecture Compatibility**

* Boson

  Sure. Previously, the RocksDB engine on the x86 platform could directly open a LevelDB database. To ensure compatibility, this scenario is no longer supported after this upgrade. If a LevelDB database exists in an x86 environment but the RocksDB engine is configured, an error will be reported and the system will fail to start.
  
 * Neo

   Agreed, to align with previous versions (previously, X86 nodes could not start on JDK 11/17), we've added a runtime check. If an X86 node is detected running a version later than JDK 8, the system will report an error and exit. This complies with official documentation that states that X86 nodes should use JDK 8.
  
   The ultimate goal is to bring RocksDB for X86 to the same version as ARM and ensure both platforms use a unified code base. This will ultimately allow both X86 and ARM to seamlessly use later JDK versions. LevelDB will still be X86-specific, but this may be unified later.
  
* Wayne
  
  Can the ARM platform support higher JDK version than JDK 17?
  
* Boson
  
  The ARM environment currently supports JDK 17. For ARM, running on JDK 17 or later (such as JDK 21) will not impose runtime restrictions, as later versions are expected to be backward compatible, and running on these versions helps verify compatibility.

  Furthermore, I suggest to simplify the `start.sh` script. The existing `start.sh` script is complex and requires JDK 17 adaptation. We have decided to retain the existing complex `start.sh` script but will not actively maintain it for now.
  
  A new, simplified script named `start.sh.simple` will be introduced. This new script will only support the start and stop commands and remove complex features. `start.sh.simple` will be clearly marked as a simple example and not suitable for production environments, which typically use customized startup scripts. This new simplified script will be compatible with both x86 and ARM platforms, and JDK 8 and JDK 17+.

* Murphy

  Alright, if there's nothing more to discuss, let's have Federico talk about the progress of cryptographic algorithm optimization.

**Optimizing cryptographic algorithm implementations**

* Federico

  The optimization work mainly targets BN128 precompiled contracts and secp256k1 signature algorithm. Previously, I shared unit test results demonstrating that the `gnark` algorithm delivers significantly better performance. Today, I will provide updated test data reflecting the overall block production performance.
  
  The integration delivered substantial performance gains across multiple modules. For BN128 precompiled contracts, addition is ~6× faster (23 μs → 4 μs), multiplication ~47× faster (2 ms → 49.7 μs), and pairing ~97× faster (62 ms → 640 μs). 
  
  In the Secp256k1 cryptographic algorithm, signature time dropped from 1.6 ms to 35 μs, and verification (ECKV2) from 1 ms to 50 μs (~18× faster) on both ARM and x86. During mainnet fast sync, block transaction signature verification latency fell from 47.3 ms to 8 ms, cutting ~39 ms per block and significantly improving sync speed, with minimal impact on block times. In the Zero-Knowledge Proof Module (ZKM) on the Nile testnet, proof verification time was reduced from ~60 ms to 6–7 ms, achieving a ~10× speedup.
  
* NEO

  This performance improvement has indeed been significant, but the team needs to further discuss specific implementation strategies, particularly the impact of BLS128 optimization on consensus. They are also considering setting signature verification asynchronously or in parallel with transaction execution, which could potentially save even more time and remains to be tested.
  
* Murphy

  Now, let's have Aiden go over the update of TIP-6780.
  
**TIP-6780: SELFDESTRUCT only in same transaction**

* Aiden

  We conducted a statistical analysis to assess the scope of the impact, including a review of current contracts and the distribution of certain assets within them. While over 5,000 contracts currently use the SELFDESTRUCT instruction, only four of these have balance more than 100,000 TRX involving it. Based on this analysis, the overall impact on existing contracts is expected to be minimal.

* Murphy

  If there are no other questions, let's proceed as decided. Thank you all for attending today. Goodbye!
