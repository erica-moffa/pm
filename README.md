# TRON Project Management Repository

This repository is used for project management for various discussions and initiatives affecting the TRON protocol.
This repository is for:

- [TRON Core Devs Meetings](https://github.com/tronprotocol/pm/tree/master/TRON%20Core%20Devs%20Meetings)
- [SR Meetings](https://github.com/tronprotocol/pm/tree/master/SR%20Meetings)
- [Mainnet Upgrade](https://github.com/tronprotocol/pm/tree/master/Mainnet%20Upgrade%20Archive) Specifications

Agendas for these meetings can be found on the [Issues](https://github.com/tronprotocol/pm/issues) tab. 

## TRON Core Devs Meetings and SR Meetings Overview

### Purpose
The TRON core devs meeting is a technical gathering for developers shaping the TRON protocol. They share project updates, discuss [TIPs](https://github.com/tronprotocol/tips) for protocol improvements, and collaborate. Conversely, the SR meeting centers on community governance and ecosystem health. Elected SRs deliberate on boosting community engagement, crafting growth policies, and addressing issues threatening community well-being. This distinction ensures both technical progress and community-led development of the TRON network receive strategic attention.

### Agenda Items
Agendas are posted to https://github.com/tronprotocol/pm/issues. Anyone is welcome to add an item to the agenda as long as it follows these guidelines:

- The topic is technical in nature
- The topic involves the TRON protocol

Please note: 

- Dapps are generally not allowed as topics 
- The topic should not be philosophical

The core devs meetings are not meant to decide philosophical contentious issues that should be decided by the community.

### Who Can Attend
These meetings are held by TRON core devs. The following groups are invited to attend the meetings:

- TRON core developers 
- client developers
- core TRON researchers  

Sometimes, a non-core java-tron developer with particular expertise on a topic is invited on to discuss a specific agenda item. If you feel you would contribute to the meetings please contact coredevs@tron.network.
